# Addeco Proyect

This is the project repository for the "Movies" test, which is divided into two parts, the Backend and the Frontend part. To test each part separately, it is necessary to go to the respective folder and follow the instructions given in README.md.

Keep in mind that the Backend repository is in hiroku, that is a platform as a service (PaaS).

And The Front part is in the Amazon S3 service, which is a service that provides object storage through a web service interface.

Finally, you can see the application working through the following URL.
